# Overview
Here are my data science and machine learning sample work while using python packages such as Pandas and SciKit-Learn! 

Since I work in a pharmaceutical company, most of my projects here will be related to biological manufacturing process monitoring and data analysis. My work ranges from:
1. Data gathering
2. Data cleaning
3. Data visualization
4. Statistical data analysis
5. Outlier / abnormality investigation
6. Overall better understanding of a process
