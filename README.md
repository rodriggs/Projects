# Overview
Here are my data science and machine learning sample projects, using python packages such as Pandas and SciKit-Learn! 

## [NLP - Social Meda App Multi-Label Classification][https://github.com/rosscleung/Projects/tree/master/NLP%20-%20Social%20Meda%20App%20Multi-Label%20Classification]
* Using some real data from a social media app, I recreate what I think is their multi-label classification and recommendation technique.

## NLP - Classifying Email Authors
* A fun, quick exercise to show how a commonly used NLP classifer (Naive Bayes) can identify the author of an email from two of my colleagues.
* This technique can be applied to more than just identifying authors. It can be used to develop a model to identify spam emails or do sentiment analysis.

## Biologics Outlier Detection:
* Pharmaceutical production outlier detection
* Used data visualization and supervised machine learning to characterize the probability of an outlier occuring (Logistic Regression)

## Biologics Yield Study:
* Comprehensive study on what impacts a drug's production yield
* Used feature selection, regression models, and classification models to study the data

## Neural Network MNIST Digit Set
* An example showing a multi-layer perceptron (back propagation neural network) algorithm that is newly added to SciKit-Learn 0.18 used to recognize images with numbers on them, i.e. the famous MNIST digit set.

## Predicting Market Demand
* A regression exercise to fill in missing market demand data that is essential in an investment decision

## Data Processing Automation Script:
* Python script used in conjunction with SQL to process and clean data to cut down the time needed to process the data. No machine learning here.

## Tutorial Notebooks
* Smaller notebooks that showcase concepts that I think others might find valuable, topics include:
	* Custom Transformer, Pipeline, and FeatureUnion
	* Nested Cross Validation
	* Unsupervised Learning Performance - Silhouette Score Analysis
	* Multi-Label Classification
