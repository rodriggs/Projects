# Project Summary
This project explores outliers detection in a pharmaceutical environment.

The goal of this project is to characterize how the features impact the target, especially where outliers have the highest chance of occuring.

A simple regression analysis was conducted just to see the non-linear relationship between one of the features with the target. A more involved classification model building exercise with model selection and cross validation is the focus of this project.
