# Project Summary
In this folder, you will find my sample work files on building a predictive model for one of my company's drug yield.

I went through the entire data science workflow in this exercise, including:

1. Data acquisition
2. Data cleaning
3. Feature selection
4. Feature engineering
5. Dimensional reduction
6. Model building

Many types of regression and classification models were fitted to the data. I hope they will be of use for your reference!
