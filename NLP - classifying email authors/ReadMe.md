# Introduction
As a quick and fun exercise, I built an Natural Language Processing (NLP) classifier that can determine whether an email is authored by one of two of my colleagues. NLP is a technique that is commonly used to identify author, detect spam, detect fraud (as in the case in the famous Enron email dataset), and conduct sentiment analysis.

This project did not go through a rigorous hyperparameter tuning or cross validation. A simple train test split on the data was used, and the classifier performed surprisingly well despite the small amount of data set that I used.
